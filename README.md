# Perspective_Transformation_Layer_PyTorch
Perspective Transformation Layer **ported to Pytorch**


## Introduction
The perspective transformation transformation layer can learn adjustable number of multiple viewpoints(homography). See the original [repo](https://github.com/kcnishan/Perspective_Transformation_Layer) for details.

It's based on tensorflow, and we ported it to Pytorch with the help of Copilot. While it might have bugs. And we have not tested it on real datasets.
